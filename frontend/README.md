---

## FOR FIRST TIME RUNNING FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

### 1. Verify Node.js and npm

In **Command Prompt**, run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If these fail, it means you do not have Node installed and will need to do so.

Go to: https://nodejs.org/en/download

Download and install the LTS version of Node.js.

Reopen Command Prompt and re-run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### 2. Go to the frontend folder

### 3. Install dependencies (one time per machine)

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev

```

### 5. Open URL in your browser to see the app.

Should look like: http://localhost:(port)/
